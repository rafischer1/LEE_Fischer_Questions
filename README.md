> The answers to each problem are provided here as both pdf and md files. For problem 1 I have created a node package in order to debug the original file. For a 'side-by-side' comparison I have only made one commit to the `geopositions_error.js` so please refer to the commit histoy for the differentials.

## Coding

1. Please refer to the file.​ Please fix any mistakes found in the node.js code. What 3 questions would you ask to be able to fix this code? What assumptions did you make to complete? If you see multiple solutions for a problem please explain why you chose the answer you pursued?

## Problem Solving

2. Imagine that you are given an assignment to build an app that brings together 3 different platforms that LEE members use within one mobile-friendly interface. You are brand new at LEE, so don’t know much about the 3 platforms beyond the platform and API documentation that the product managers have provided. How would you go about building an app with limited information? What steps would you take to first start and then complete this assignment?

## Work Sample

3. Please provide the code to a sample project you’ve programmed as part of your previous work. If possible, please use a sample that you either worked on more independently or participated in the scoping/decision-making. Tell us about the project. Why was the project initiated? Why did you choose to build it the way you did? What challenges did you face when completing the project? How did you address those challenges? Anything else you’d like to share that gives us insight into your working style?
