# Problem 1 - Fix This Code! ðŸ’»

## What 3 questions would you ask to be able to fix this code?

1. Do I understand what is happening? What are the input/outputs?

- What functionality do the imported packages provide?

`bluebird` is a third party promise library for easy handling of asynchronous code

`promise-throttle` limits the amount of promises given a certain amount of requests/time and implementing the Bluebird promise library

`sequelize` is an ORM tool for node and must be imported and initialized which is missing from this file. The first part of the exported file uses the `sequelize` package to define a table 'Geoposition' with the appropriate fields. To fully integrate the package I initialized a database connection and removed the function parameters `(sequelize, Datatypes)` changing each `Datatype` to the `Sequelize` field import type. In order to actually query the table in the options object you have to create a model name by setting the `sequelize.define` method to a variable.

The `classMethods` defined in the option object of the model format the information from the API call. Logging out the `[table].options.classMethods`:

```json
{ associate: [Function: associate], geocode: [AsyncFunction: geocode] }
```

The next big function is the `classMethods.geocode()`. The query parameter is 'sanitized' into the correct format using regex (e.g. `/[^\x00-\x7F]/` is a negated set that makes sure no character from NULL to DEL is present). In the final regex the goal is to reduce any repeated whitespace to a single space so it should be: `...sanitizedAddress.replace(/\s/, '');`

To test this method I have been using the following function call from a separate file:

```js
const geopositions = require('./app');
const query = 'test formatting  query';
let result = geopositions.options.classMethods.geocode(query);
console.log('result:', result);
```

Eventually, what is returned is a new address object ready to be inserted as an entry into the `geopositions` table with all of the fields generated from the result of the Google API call.

2. When a bug is found, what is its impact?

> The 80/20 rule states: '80% of the bugs are found in 20% of the code"

- Initial flags: asynchronous code!

  - the `geoCode` class method needs to be declared an asynchronous function in order to await the result of the API call. Each `await` is a promise unable to resolve unless preceded by `async` on its function declaration.

- Do the fields defined in the table match the keys in the returned object?

  - The table definition is missing the field of `premise` LINE 38

3. Are there any JavaScript language errors related to syntax/lexical/operator placement?

- Most notable are the multiple improper uses of the comparison operator versus the assignment operator:

```js
if ((result.status = 'OVER_QUERY_LIMIT')) {
  throw new Error('OVER_QUERY_LIMIT');
}

// this is a comparison statement - change to:

if (result.status === 'OVER_QUERY_LIMIT') {
  throw new Error('OVER_QUERY_LIMIT');
}

// also:
if (result.status != 'OK')
// should be:
if (result.status !== 'OK')
```

and also in the `address_components` assignment forEach():

```js
 if (component.types.some(type => (type = 'premise'))) {
    address.premise = component.long_name;

    // should be for each field:
  type => (type === 'premise')
```

- The use of `.find()` on line 115 is a bit strange because `.find()` takes a callback function to find the position of a matched condition in an array. Unless the `this` is meant to refer to a sequelize `findAll` method in which change to:

```js
// SELECT * FROM geopositons WHERE query = coalescedAddress;
let cached = await geopositions.findAll({
  where: {
    query: coalescedAddress
  }
});
```

I am really not sure about getting through this error. When `allowPartial` is set to false this cached query is skipped over straight to the Api call. Since there is only a `findAll` method in sequelize I am guessing it has something to do with not being able to properly refer to the defined table and make the query. It looks as though `.find` is also deprecated in the sequelize package.

- Also: in these final instances the `this` is referring to the `classMethods` object which does not contain a `find()` or `create()` method (es5 function declaration of the methods) `<rejected> TypeError: this.find is not a function`. I have been able to get around this error by defining the Model in the initial `sequelize.define` call and using this Model as the query target for both `Model.find()` and `Model.create()`. [sequealize docs](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/getting-started.html#modeling-a-table)

### What assumptions did you make to complete?

- I assume that in the `../config/google-apis` file not provided the api is initialized with url and key and returns the API call url to which the coalescedAddress is concatenated to make the `geocodeAsync` call. This returns a result that will be checked and parsed into the address returned by the file.

- That `cached.get()` actually returns a value. I am only familiar with the `.get()` where it accepts a key or string as a parameter

- That this would mostly be a JavaScript syntax solving problem...I must admit I have used Knex as my main ORM for node/express and I have spent much of my time on this problem troubleshooting various versioning issues with the sequelize package in order to establish a local dev postgres database connection. Once established I am able to see that I am indeed querying the database but without the proper formatting of the gmAPI connection I will be unable to refactor the file further.

```sql
Executing (default): SELECT "id", "query", "formatted_address" AS "formattedAddress", "lat", "lng", "premise", "subpremise", ... "modified" AS "updatedAt" FROM "geopositions" AS "Geoposition" WHERE "Geoposition"."query" = 'test formatting  query';
```
